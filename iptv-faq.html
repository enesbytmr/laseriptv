                      <p>Firstly, download VLC Media Player from the official website or trusted sources on the internet, based on your operating system.

                        Once the download is complete, install the application on your computer.
                        
                        Launch VLC Media Player, and click on the "Media" option from the top menu.
                        
                        Select "Open Network Stream" from the drop-down menu.
                        
                        Next, enter the M3U URL provided by your IPTV distributor into the text box and click on "Play".
                        
                        Your playlist will then be loaded, and you can press "CTRL+L" to bring up the playlist.
                        
                        From here, you can select your desired channel and start watching live TV.
                        
                        By following these simple steps, you can easily set up VLC Media Player to watch live TV using an IPTV service.

                        <p>M3U stands for MP3 URL. It is a format primarily associated with audio playlists, but has been expanded to include visual information and can be used for multimedia files. Multimedia players use M3U files to queue up files for playback. It is one of the most widely used formats on MP3 players for audio compilations, and is popular in the IPTV industry for live streaming.

                          An M3U file contains information about the media you want to add to your playlist. For IPTV services, you can add data about the channels you want to watch by using a text file to edit and compile the file.</p>

                                Please note: Initially, the app provides you with a free 7-day trial. After the app expires, you can purchase it again via in-app micro-transaction or visit the website and purchase the license.
                                
                                Step 2: After opening the application, you will see your TV MAC address.
                                
                                Write it down to prepare for the next step.
                                
                                Step 3: Open the playlist uploader webpage by opening this URL http://siptv.eu/mylist/
                                
                                Enter your TV MAC address and the M3U URL received from us, mark "Keep Online," and press "Add Link."
                                
                                It is better to add an M3U link and not use the static M3U file to receive all new updates.
                                
                                Step 4: After successfully uploading your playlist, restart the Smart IPTV application, and the channels will be displayed.
                                
                                Password for adult content
                                
                                To unlock adult content in your Smart TV application, you can try 0000, 1234, or 1122.

                          <p>Apple TV is a powerful media device used for streaming media content, including live streaming. It supports an HDMI connection, comes with an infrared-based remote control, and can be connected to the internet via Wi-Fi. Additionally, users can stream media content from AirPlay or iTunes. You can install IPTV on Apple TV using the IP Television app.

                            Step 1: First, download the iPlayTV app from the App Store and click on "Add Playlist".
                            
                            Step 2: Go to the "Xtream Server" and select to continue to the next section.
                            
                            Step 3: Now, you need to fill out the entries as described below and then click on "Save".
                            
                            *Playlist name: You can give any name you like, e.g. MY IPTV.
                            
                            *Server URL: Here, you need to use the server name provided by your IPTV distributor.
                            
                            *Username: Enter the username provided by your IPTV dealer.
                            
                            *Password: Enter the password provided by your IPTV dealer.
                            
                            You can find all of these details in your M3U URL.
                            
                            Now, your iPlayTV is ready to stream IPTV channels on your Apple TV.
                            
                            To get a visualization of downloading and setting up IPTV with the iPLAY app, you can watch some videos on youtube.com.

                              <p>As part of the Android operating system, there is a restriction that blocks the installation of applications outside of the Google Play Store.

                                When you first try to install an app from an unknown source, you will be greeted with the following message:
                                
                                "Installation blocked. For security reasons, your phone is set to block installations of applications that are not from the Play Store."
                                
                                If you have a phone with Android Oreo or higher, you will not see a setting to allow installation of apps from unknown sources. Instead, Google treats this as an app permission and you will be asked every time you want to install an app that you received from Applivery.
                                
                                But what should you do to proceed with the installation?
                                
                                Follow these steps to allow app installations from unknown sources:
                                
                                Go to Settings > Security.
                                
                                Enable the "Unknown Sources" option.
                                
                                Tap OK in the prompt.
                                
                                Select "Trust".
                                
                                That's it, now you can try to install the application again. Note that these settings will be permanently saved in your operating system and you can install Android apps from ALL sources.
                                
                                You are still protected
                                
                                Even if apps are installed from unknown sources, Google Play Protect continues to scan apps, look for viruses, malware, and block prohibited apps.</p>

                              <p>First, search for "IPTV M3U" on the internet and download an M3U file for your preferred channels from a reputable website of your choice. For example, you can download a list of German channels here.
                                On your Android TV, you now need a file explorer. We recommend the ES File Explorer. You should also download a player, such as VLC.
                                Open the app and unzip the downloaded ZIP file until you have the actual M3U file.
                                Then select the M3U file and open it with VLC. Here you can conveniently receive all your channels. To switch channels, tap the round playlist icon in the top right corner.
